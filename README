This project is to create a grammar that will be used with Ian Holmes's xrate software. It will annotate genome sequences in a phylogenetic tree.

Generator takes an input file organized like input.gene and creates a file in stockholm format that can be fed into crate.

If the outputs of xrate and Generator are piped into files then Difference finder can read these files to find out where crate made mistakes.

I've written a short script testxrate.sh that will run Generator, xrate and Difference finder automatically. It needs to be edited so that it has the correct input file for Generator, the correct xrate grammar file and the location of the xrate executable.
